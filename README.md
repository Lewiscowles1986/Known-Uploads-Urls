# Known-Uploads-Urls
PoC plugin to add some routes to WithKnown to allow uploading as URL

Essentially, instead of physically uploading a file, this plugin will allow frontend to receive URL's for sound, image, etc attachments

The purpose is to experiment and perhaps make something mergeable into the core of Known to revise the software strategy to slim-down core responsibilities.
